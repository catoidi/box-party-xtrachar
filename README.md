# box-party-xtrachar
This is an addon for Box Party Demo that adds 3 new playable characters, each with their own unique looks and mechanics.

This is not compatible with the full version of Box Party.

To install, simply download the "boxparty-full.pk3" in the Releases page and place the file in your Box Party Demo folder. The game will then autoload this addon everytime you start Box Party Demo.
